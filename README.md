# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

For this project we used Machine learning and Neural Networks, one feature used was to create a binary classifier which will help to predict if the applicant will be funded by the charitable organization, Alphabet Soup, will be successful. We had a dataset that contained various measures on over 30,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. 

Steps used for Analysis 
* preprocessing the data from the neural network
* Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model
* Optimizing the Model

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
